# 40MHz-GPS-FT8-WSPR-MEPT
This project uses the very popular Arduino Nano and Si5351A clock generator board to generate FT8 or WSPR signals.  Frequency and time accuracy are maintained by using an inexpensive (NEO-6M) GPS receiver board. A 60 minute schedule sets operation on the 40.62 or 40.68 Mhz band and the mode of operation.  Other frequencies below 40 MHz may also be used.
